  <p>Enjoy preparing for a party together
  Time span: Sep 2018 - Present

  My Role: User research, User interview, Rapid prototype,

  wireframe and interface design.

  CHALLENGE
  How to make the party planning process easier?
  Even though hosting and attending a party is a common thing for us to spend spare time and celebrate important events. Hosting party is a complicated and annoying thing. People are seeking solutions to hosting a perfect party all over the internet. However, hosting a party is like managing multiple tasks, there are various things to think about, including budgets, guests list, food, and drinks, etc. Besides, It is difficult to satisfy all participants when hosting a party.

  SOLUTION OVERVIEW
  ​Plan
  Invite friends work Together
  Chat
  Create and vote
  Parddy provides solutions to help people create and manage party plan smoothly, invite friends to create and vote for the plan, make new friends easily by group chat that generated by every plan automatically.
  RESEARCH  PROCESS
  Parddy is a mobile app design of a semester-long solo project. I conducted the user research and design process, from observing people on the field when they make party plans to validating design decisions by testing with target users. My design evolved along several rounds of iteration at different stages.

  As a party animal, I couldn't wait to figure out how people think about hosting parties.
  RESEARCH
  Interviews
  Several rounds of Interviews are conducted with some of my friends who hosted or attended parties before. It turned out that their frustrations stemmed from the following aspects:

  Personas
  I created multiple personas based on the findings from research. The personas represent users’ goals and pain points that helped me to prioritize different user needs to guide the converging phase of my design process.
  Competitive Analysis
  I analyzed multiple existing matching platforms, both physical and digital, including Meetup, Facebook Events, Doodle, Party planner Pro and how students clubs host parties, to explore the current solution space users can utilize to plan for parties. I discovered four main findings that led to users’ frustrations.

  Findings
  No detailed plan function

  Hard to work together

  Multiple communicate channels

  The gap between different friend circle

  IDEATION
  Storyboards
  Based on the findings, I looked up current and possible solutions to tackle the users’ needs, and then expanded the sketches into scenarios that captured users’ pain points, emotion, and interactions with each solution.
  Through the investigation of competitive analysis and current solutions, I found out that there is a pain point of transition between making plans in multiple people. In order to discuss a single plan, the user needs to go through various Apps Switching between plan application and message application.

  In order to simplify the party plan process, I aimed to create a simple user-centered design application that could integrate features hosting a party needs and aim to insights.
  PROTOTYPE
  During the prototype phase, I started in wireframe to figure out the information structure, and then make the paper prototype to do the rapid prototype and user test to evaluate flow and interaction. After that, I added visual language and crafted the high-fidelity prototype and conducted two more round user testing.

  DESIGN DETAILS
  Create a new party plan

  Invite participants easily

  Participants can choose and vote time together



  Participants can add and vote for foods and drinks, music at the party. The host can manage the budget.

  Participants can chat in a group chat that generated automatically based on the plan, which helps people make new friends easily.

  DESIGN ITERATION
  Plan feature has several small features like time poll, participants, food & drinks. Those features should belong to Plan Feature Level and should be clear to users.

  Wrong hierarchical relationship

  Overwhelming tab.
  low readability.
  Adjust the hierarchical distribution
  Reduce cluttering,
  Creating a new plan is the first step. The design of this page has to follow logical thinking. Using pop out to prompt users to input name and location, choose module they want to manage(Time Poll, Participants, Foods & Drinks, music, Budget), which can reduce confusion, make the process more clearly and more customized.

  Used plan can provide template for users
  Input process make users feel confused
  Pop out guide users to fill

  Created Plan can show plan status, inform users of progress according to the estimated number set ahead of time.

  Set estimated participants number
  Visually but not straightforward
  Readable
  INTERACTIVE PROTOTYPE
